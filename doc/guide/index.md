# Introduction to Ligt

Interlinear glossed text is a notation used in various fields of linguistics to provide readers 
with a way to understand linguistic phenomena in linguistic examples and to provide detailed grammatical annotation 
for corpus data when documenting endangered languages.
This data is usually provided with morpheme-by-morpheme correspondence which is not supported 
by any established vocabularies for representing linguistic corpora or automated annotations.

Interlinear Glossed Text can be stored and exchanged in several formats specifically designed for the purpose, 
but these differ in their designs and concepts, 
and they are tied to particular tools, so the reusability of the annotated data is limited.

Ligt representation can help improve interoperability and reusability, allowing to convert such glosses to a tool-independent RDF 
representation well-suited for the Web of Data.

Beyond establishing structural (format) interoperability by means of a common data representation,
Ligt also allows using shared vocabularies and terminology repositories available from the (Linguistic) Linked Open Data cloud. 

In the next section we introduce the basic concepts of the vocabulary.
